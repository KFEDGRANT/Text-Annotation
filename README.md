# Text-Annotation-for-AWS-Comprehend
Generate CSV files for custom entity recognition with AWS Comprehend ML natural language processing


The first three programs in this project read text from .doc, .docx, and .pdf files and save to .txt for use in Amazon Web Service 
natural language processing program, Comprehend. 

The fourth program parses the text from each .txt file for custom entity recognition, generating a .csv file annotation schema in the required format for Comprehend.

All programs are written in python, with the excetpion of .doc to .docx, which is written in VBA and should be executed in the Microsoft 
Office Visual Basic Editor. Minimum 1000 annotated .txt files required for Comprehend. 

Novice programmer here, any factoring suggestions much appreciated.
